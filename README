NAME
    IO::Socket::Happpy::EyeBalls - Perl implementation of RFC6555 - Happy
    Eyeballs

VERSION
    This document describes IO::Socket::Happpy::EyeBalls version 0.0.2

SYNOPSIS
        use IO::Socket::Happpy::EyeBalls;
        my $socket = IO::Socket::Happpy::EyeBalls->new(
            Proto    => 'tcp',
            PeerAddr => $addr,
            PeerPort => $port,
        );
        $socket->connected;
        warn $socket->sockdomain # PF_INET or PF_INET6

DESCRIPTION
    This module is Perl implementation of RFC6555 - Happy Eyeballs.

    The implementation of RFC6555 here is same as web browsers
    implementation such as google chrome or firefox, describes as "6.
    Example Algorithm" in RFC6555 as far as I understand.

    This modules tries to connect ipv6 address first if exists. Wait for
    300ms (can be changed by ConnectTimeout param). if the session has be
    connected before its timeout, returns ipv6 socket. Otherwise passes
    arguments to base class (IO::Socket::INET). # And it tries to connect
    ipv4 address.

    This module is yet experimental. There are plenty way to implement
    RFC6555 and this is one example.

    Known issues below.

    - Namespace is too long. Maybe it does not require the indipendent
    namespace but an option paramater of the IO::Socket::IP is enough. Like
    this.

        my $socket = IO::Socket::IP->new(
            Proto     => 'tcp',
            PeerAddr  => $addr,
            PeerPort  => $port,
            Algorithm => 'happyeyeballs',
        );

    - AE::io is better for the io watcher to detect if the ipv6 socket has
    been connected. I don't use it because for the simplicity though.

  Methods
    configure
        override the configure method and tries to connect ipv6 first. Fall
        backs to base class method is ipv6 connection fails.
