IO-Socket-Happpy-EyeBalls version 0.0.1

This module is Perl implementation of RFC6555 - Happy Eyeballs.

The implementation of RFC6555 here is same as web browsers implementation 
such as google chrome or firefox,
describes as "6.  Example Algorithm" in RFC6555 as far as I understand.

This modules tries to connect ipv6 address first if exists.
Wait for 300ms (can be changed by ConnectTimeout param).
if the session has be connected before its timeout, returns ipv6 socket.
Otherwise passes arguments to base class (IO::Socket::INET).
# And it tries to connect ipv4 address.
